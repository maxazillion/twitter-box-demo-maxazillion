## what he code does

This program has a text box that you can write in. The numbers on the right hand side update the number of characters as you type. The numbers will turn red if there are too many chars. The button will only be active if there are chars inside of the text box.

## What I learned

I practiced taking files from another repo and using them on my own computer. I practiced making good commit messages. I Learned how to use javascript to manipulate the css of certain elements.
